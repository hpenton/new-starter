        <p>Hello. 🤗</p>
        <p>
          We just want to make sure that you have access and you've gotten
          onto slack and connected to channels
          like #worth-reading, #tech and other things that float your boat like
          ⛄️ #snowfeverworth and #food.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll help you get to know the project that you're on, but don't worry
          about that right now!
        </p>
        <p>
          Where do <em>you</em> want to go? We'll be talking to you about
          progression and lots of other things! But again don't worry about that
          yet. 🙂
