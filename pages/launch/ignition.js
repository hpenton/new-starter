      <p>Hello. ü§ó</p>
      <p>
        We just want to make sure that you have access and you've gotten
        onto slack and connected to channels
        like #worth-reading, #tech and other things that float your boat like
        ‚õÑÔ∏è #snowfeverworth and #food.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll help you get to know the project that you're on, but don't worry
        about that right now!
      </p>
      <p>
        Where do
        <em>you</em>
        want to go? We'll be talking to you about
        progression and lots of other things! But again don't worry about that
        yet. üôÇ
