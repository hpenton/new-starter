        <p>We'll be getting you into a project as quickly as possible. We operate
        a lot as a mob (you'll understand more about what that means as you go along).
        It's essentially a team, but you'll work on the same thing together. This
        is quicker than working as individuals, because you can make decisions much
    quicker. More important at the moment, though, is that it's a great place to
    learn. It'll put you in driving seat quickly and you'll have the support so you
    won't feel alone and you won't fear mistakes.</p>

    <p>To work in the mob you're going to have to get connected to the source code
    (github, bitbucket, Azure Devops etc) - i.e. the products we build - 
    get connected to the project mission / goals - i.e. what we're building and why.
    Our teams are often a hybrid of Worth employees, contractors and clients - we're
    all aligned on the common goal so we're all equal, open and mostly friendly.
    You'll get invites to common ceremonies such as stand ups, show and tells.</p>

    <p>You'll also need to log your time (Harvest). Once we're out of lock down you
    may need to claim expenses (Expensify). You'll probably want to book holidays
    (timestastic).</p>
